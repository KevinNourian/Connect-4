# Connect 4

## Description
This program simulates Connect Four, which is a two-player board game.

## Rules
* The players choose a color and then take turns dropping colored discs into a seven-column and six-row matrix vertically.
* The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. 
* The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four discs of a player's color. 

## Technologies
I used `NumPy` to create the board.

## Execution
Run `Connect4.py`

## Notes
I used 1 and 2 to show the two different color pieces.
